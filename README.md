# Capstone-DAC

This Project is a Direct Air Capture Device (DAC) to remove Carbon Dioxide (CO2) directly from the air. The DAC device utilizes a microcontroller-based system to monitor different environmental variables through sensors and control mechanisms to collect the maximum amount of CO2 while reducing energy usage. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller and a custom-printed circuit board to monitor different sensor inputs, control the system outputs, and determine the proper process to be performed. The adsorption process will runs two fans to intake air and collect the CO2 and will have an exhaust to remove the excess air from the system. Once the device is saturated with CO2, the system will enter the desorption process, where the goal is to condense and separate the CO2. The CO2 is then separated and safely stored.
